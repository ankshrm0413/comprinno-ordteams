1. Takes the no of tests as input T.
2. Perform all the validity checks on 1 ≤ i ≤ 2, i+1-th.
3. Checks the the fuction def g(x,y):
4. Gets user input and returns a string splits that input on whitespaces, applies the function fn to each element in the sequence, applies int to each string element in the input and turns any iterator/generator to a list. Perform all the validity checks on a, b, c.
5. Reads the value from the list and checks the reason and update the value to d and e.
6. Return the maximum topics and the number of teams that know that are their scores in three skills - hard work, intelligence and persistence.
7. Checks the list a,b,c from the above function def g(x,y) and checks wether its satisfy as true or false.
8. Perform two values from the list and store it to the variable d,e.
9. We can order them as (3, 2, 1). Person 3 is better than Person 2 because his scores in the first two skills are not lesser than Person 2’s. And in skill 3, Person 3 scores higher. Similarly, Person 2 is better than Person 1. He scores more than Person 1 in every skill, in fact.
10. s1, s2 and s3, person x is said to be better than another person y if x doesn’t score less than y in any of the skills and scores more than y in at least one skill.
